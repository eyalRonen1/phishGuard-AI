# PhishGuard AI: Phishing Message Classification System

## Overview
PhishGuard AI is a system designed to identify and prevent phishing attempts through advanced artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques. This project aims to enhance information security by detecting phishing strategies and distinguishing them from legitimate communications effectively and efficiently.

## Features
- **Text Analysis:** Deep analysis of message structures, keyword usage, and linguistic patterns.
- **Link and Content Testing:** Examination of suspicious links and content within messages to prevent phishing attacks.
- **Real-time Detection:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for immediate and effective phishing detection.
- **User Interface:** Simple and intuitive local user interface for easy operation and clear data presentation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishguard-ai.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd phishguard-ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run PhishGuard AI, execute:
```bash
python phishguard.py
```

## How It Works
PhishGuard AI employs several machine learning algorithms to analyze email and text messages for phishing patterns. The system scans and evaluates each message, flagging those that exhibit characteristics typical of phishing attempts.
