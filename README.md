# PhishGuard AI: Advanced Email Phishing Detection System

## Overview
PhishGuard AI is an advanced email analysis system designed to identify and prevent phishing attempts using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques. The system employs the DistilBERT architecture along with traditional machine learning approaches to provide accurate phishing detection capabilities.

## Features
- **Advanced NLP Analysis:** Utilizes DistilBERT for deep linguistic analysis and context understanding
- **Multi-Model Comparison:** Implements multiple machine learning algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
- **Intuitive GUI:** Modern interface with real-time analysis feedback and risk assessment
- **Batch Processing:** Support for analyzing multiple emails simultaneously
- **File Format Support:** Handles various email formats including .msg, .eml, and .txt files
- **Risk Classification:** Five-level risk assessment system with detailed recommendations
- **Analysis History:** Tracks and stores previous analysis results for reference
- **Export Capabilities:** Results can be exported to CSV format for further analysis


## Results
The system achieves high accuracy in phishing detection:
- DistilBERT Model: 97.62% F1-score
- XGBoost Model: 88.23% F1-score
- Other models show varying performance between 75-87% F1-score
